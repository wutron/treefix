DEPENDENCIES

TreeFix has the following requirements:

- Python (2.5.4) -- http://python.org/

The following programs are optional:
- Numpy (1.5.1) -- http://numpy.scipy.org/
  If Numpy is not found, the program uses Python's built-in 'random' module.

Additionally, a python module is required for computing the test statistic for
likelihood equivalence.  We have provided one using RAxML at 
http://compbio.mit.edu/treefix/raxml.

INSTALL

Run "python setup.py install".

If you don't have permission to install software on your system, you can install
into another directory using the --prefix or --home flags to setup.py.

For example
::
python setup.py install --prefix=/home/username/python
or
python setup.py install --home=~
::

If you didn't install in the standard bin directory
you will need to set your PATH variable to the alternate location.

If you didn't install in the standard Python site-packages directory
you will need to set your PYTHONPATH variable to the alternate location.
See http://docs.python.org/inst/search-path.html for further details.
