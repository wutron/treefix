=============================================================================
DEPENDENCIES

TreeFix-DTL has the following requirements:

- Python (2.5.4) -- http://python.org/
- GCC compiler (4.1.2) -- http://gcc.gnu.org/
- SWIG (1.3.29) -- http://www.swig.org/

The following programs are optional:
- Numpy (1.5.1) -- http://www.numpy.org/
  If Numpy is not found, the program uses Python's built-in 'random' module.
- Scipy (0.7.1) -- http://www.scipy.org/
  If Scipy is not found, the program uses internal libraries to approximate
  the normal distribution (so p-values may be slightly off).

Additionally, Python modules are required for computing (1) p-values for likelihood
equivalence and (2) reconciliation costs.  We have provided default modules
that compute (1) the p-value based on the Shimodaira-Hasegawa (SH) test statistic with
RAxML site-wise likelihoods and (2) the duplication-transfer-loss cost
using ranger-dtl-U reconciliation.  For other modules, see the website.

INSTALL

Run

python setup.py build
python setup.py install

If you don't have permission to install software on your system, you can install
into another directory using the --prefix or --home flags to setup.py.

For example
::
python setup.py install --prefix=/home/username/python
or
python setup.py install --home=~
::

If you didn't install in the standard bin directory
you will need to set your PATH variable to the alternate location.

If you didn't install in the standard Python site-packages directory
you will need to set your PYTHONPATH variable to the alternate location.
See http://docs.python.org/inst/search-path.html for further details.

=============================================================================
INSTALL (if TreeFix is already installed)

Run

python setup_DTL.py install

This installs the files that are specific to TreeFix-DTL or RANGER-DTL.
In particular, it installs the "ranger-dtl-U" and "treefixDTL" executables and
the "rangerdtlmodel.py" module to their appropriate paths.

If you did not use the default paths, you must also specify the TreeFix installation directory.
Using the regular setup.py script will work (as long as you use the same installation directory),
but you will be (unnecessarily) recompiling TreeFix and overwriting any existing ranger-dtl-U executable.

to their appropriate paths.
